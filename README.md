# Probability Calculator for Card Games (and Beyond)

This project is a Python-based probability calculator primarily designed for scenarios involving **draws without replacement** using the **hypergeometric distribution**. While the original use-case focused on card games (like Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc.), the tools provided here can be applied to a wide range of problems in statistics and probability theory.

The project currently consists of interactive Jupyter notebooks that calculate and visualize probabilities using 3D plots.

---

## Features

- Calculate the probability of drawing specific card combinations.
- Visualize probabilities using 3D surface plots.
- Designed for modification: easily change parameters to test different scenarios.
- Built using core Python libraries like `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Probability-calculator-for-card-games-mostly-.git
cd Probability-calculator-for-card-games-mostly-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can manually install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

---

## Usage

Open the notebooks in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook. Each notebook contains an interactive visualization and can be modified to suit your use-case.

### Notebook Overview

- **`Probability to draw exactly ka A and exactly kb B (3D plot).ipynb`**  
  Calculates and visualizes the probability of drawing *exactly* `ka` items of type A and `kb` items of type B.

- **`Probability to draw at least ka A and exactly kb B (3D plot).ipynb`**  
  Calculates the probability of drawing *at least* `ka` items of type A and *exactly* `kb` items of type B.

- **`Probability to draw at least ka A and at least kb B (3D plot).ipynb`**  
  Calculates the probability of drawing *at least* `ka` items of type A and *at least* `kb` items of type B.

Each of these notebooks generates a **3D surface plot** for visual analysis.

### Example

In the notebook, you can modify variables such as:

- ka the number of items of type A you want
- kb the number of items of type B you want
- total-cards
- hand-size

```python
html.Label("Total Cards"),
    dcc.Slider(id='total-cards', min=40, max=60, step=1, value=40, marks={i: str(i) for i in range(40, 61, 5)}),
    html.Label("Hand Size"),
    dcc.Slider(id='hand-size', min=1, max=60, step=1, value=5, marks={i: str(i) for i in range(1, 61, 5)}),
    html.Label("ka"),
    dcc.Slider(id='ka', min=0, max=10, step=1, value=2, marks={i: str(i) for i in range(0, 11)}),
    html.Label("kb"),
    dcc.Slider(id='kb', min=0, max=10, step=1, value=1, marks={i: str(i) for i in range(0, 11)})
```

Run the notebook to update the calculations and see how the probabilities shift with different parameters.
